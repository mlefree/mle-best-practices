# MLE Best Practices Progress

## What Works
- **Project Discovery**: The find-projects.js script successfully identifies projects with bpstatus.json files
- **Compliance Checking**: The check-gitignore.js script verifies if projects follow the same .gitignore standards
- **Status Tracking**: Projects' bpstatus.json files are updated with compliance information (.gitignore: true/false)
- **Configuration**: Environment variables are properly loaded from .env files
- **Reporting**: Markdown reports are generated with project information and compliance status
- **Documentation**: README.md provides clear instructions for using all tools
- **Exclusion Rules**: Scripts respect the exclusion rules in bpstatus.json and don't update excluded projects
- **Project Type Detection**: Projects are automatically classified as app, package, or standalone based on git branches
- **Release Scripts Cleanup**: Unnecessary release scripts are removed based on project type
- **Commit Management**: The squash-commits.js script allows merging all commits from a branch into one
- **Release Verification**: The check-before-release.js script verifies project status before release
- **Consolidated Reporting**: STATUS_ALL.gitignored.md provides comprehensive status information across all projects

## What's Left to Build
1. **Additional Compliance Checks**:
   - Check for proper package.json structure and essential fields
   - Check for presence of essential files (README.md, LICENSE, etc.)
   - Check for proper testing setup and configuration
   - Check for proper CI/CD configuration
   - Check for security best practices

2. **Enhanced Project Analysis**:
   - Aggregate and analyze the content of bpstatus.json files across projects
   - Calculate overall compliance scores and metrics
   - Track compliance changes over time

3. **Visualization Tools**:
   - Generate visual representations of best practices adoption
   - Create dashboards to display compliance status across projects
   - Provide charts to track progress over time

4. **Automation Features**:
   - Automatically fix non-compliant aspects where possible
   - Implement scheduled compliance checks
   - Add CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Create a notification system for compliance changes

## Current Status
- **Version**: 0.0.10 (Development in progress)
- **Phase**: Enhanced functionality implemented
- **Focus**: Project discovery, compliance checking, reporting, and project type management

The project now has the following functionality:
1. Discover projects with bpstatus.json files
2. Check projects for compliance with .gitignore standards
3. Update projects' bpstatus.json files with compliance information
4. Generate reports on project discovery and compliance status
5. Detect project types (app, package, or standalone) based on git branches
6. Clean up release scripts based on project type
7. Respect exclusion rules in bpstatus.json
8. Copy memory bank rules to other projects

This enhanced foundation provides a solid base for implementing additional best practice checks and more advanced features.

## Known Issues
1. **Performance**: Large directory structures may take time to scan
   - Potential solution: Implement caching or incremental scanning

2. **Simple Comparison**: The .gitignore check only verifies if all reference lines exist
   - Future enhancement: Add more sophisticated comparison (order, comments, etc.)
   - Consider allowing partial matches or scoring based on percentage of matching lines

3. **Limited Compliance Checks**: Currently only checks .gitignore compliance
   - Planned enhancement: Add more best practice checks as outlined in "What's Left to Build"

4. **Manual Execution**: Tools must be run manually
   - Future improvement: Add scheduling and automation capabilities

5. **Basic Reporting**: Reports are simple markdown tables
   - Enhancement opportunity: Add more detailed and interactive reporting formats
   - Consolidate reports into a single dashboard

## Next Milestones
1. **Version 0.1.0**: Enhanced project analysis with bpstatus.json content parsing
2. **Version 0.2.0**: Visualization tools and metrics
3. **Version 0.3.0**: Automated compliance checking
4. **Version 1.0.0**: Full-featured best practices management system
