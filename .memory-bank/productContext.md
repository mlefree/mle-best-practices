# MLE Best Practices Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The MLE Best Practices project was created to address the challenge of maintaining consistent best practices across multiple JavaScript/TypeScript projects. As organizations grow and develop more projects, ensuring that each follows established best practices becomes increasingly difficult. This tool provides a standardized way to track and report on best practices adoption.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Inconsistent Standards**: Different projects often implement best practices differently or not at all
2. **Visibility Gap**: Difficult to know which projects are following best practices without manual inspection
3. **Tracking Challenges**: No easy way to track progress in adopting best practices across multiple projects
4. **Reporting Complexity**: Generating reports on best practices adoption requires manual effort

## How It Should Work
1. Projects that implement best practices include a `bpstatus.json` file in their root directory
2. The MLE Best Practices tool scans specified directories to find projects with this marker file
3. The tool generates reports listing all projects that have implemented best practices
4. Users can configure which directories to scan through environment variables
5. Reports are generated in markdown format for easy sharing and viewing

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Easy to set up and use with minimal configuration
2. **Clarity**: Clear, readable reports that provide immediate insight
3. **Automation**: Ability to run as part of CI/CD pipelines or scheduled tasks
4. **Flexibility**: Support for different project structures and organization patterns
5. **Low Overhead**: Minimal impact on existing projects and workflows
